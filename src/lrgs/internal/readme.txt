===============================================================
Package lrgs.internal contains classes that are intended to be
used only on the LRGS system. Many of these classes contain
native methods that are implemented in C or C++.

Although good programming practices were employed in the native
code, not a lot of effort was expended to ensure portability to
other operating systems and development environments.
